Principle	                                            Description
Single Responsibility Principle	       -->      Each class should be responsible for a single part or functionality of the system.
Open-Closed Principle	               -->      Software components should be open for extension, but not for modification.
Liskov Substitution Principle	       -->      Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without breaking the system.
Interface Segregation Principle	       -->      No client should be forced to depend on methods that it does not use.
Dependency Inversion Principle	       -->      High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules, both should depend on abstractions.
