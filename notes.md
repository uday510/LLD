Types of Design Patterns :
    1. Creational    2. Structural    3. Behavioural



 

1. Creational    --> associated with creation of objects.
    Singleton
    Builder
    Prototype & Registry
    ...

2.  Structural    --> structure of object
3. Behavioural    --> code on action

Singleton:
        Singleton is a creational design pattern, 
        which ensures that only one object of its kind exists and provides a 
        single point of access to it for any other code.
